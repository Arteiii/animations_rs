# Yet Another Spinner Lib

Have you ever found yourself staring blankly at your terminal, 
waiting for some command-line operation to finish, 
wondering if your computer has decided to take a coffee break without telling you? 
Fear not, for salvation is at hand!

## Introducing

After countless late nights of wrestling with terminal buffers and ASCII art, 
after more trial and error than we care to admit, 
we proudly present to you our humble attempt to make loading animations less of a headache and more of a delight.


## What's the Deal?

So, picture this: you're sipping your coffee, typing away at your command line, and suddenly, 
you need to perform some lengthy task. You hit enter, and then... silence. No feedback, no sign of progress, 
just you and your thoughts. It's like waiting for a slow-motion replay of a snail race. Cue dramatic music.

But fear not, dear developer, for now you have cli_loading_magic! With our library, 
you can add a touch of whimsy to your terminal experience. Watch as your tasks come to life with dazzling animations, 
each one carefully crafted to make you forget, if only for a moment, that you're just waiting for code to run.

## How to Use?

... ill let you know when ever I figure it out

## Disclaimer

Now, we won't promise you that cli_loading_magic will solve all your problems. 
We can't guarantee it won't crash your terminal or cause your computer to sprout legs and walk away in protest. 
But hey, life's an adventure, right? Embrace the chaos, enjoy the ride, and remember: if all else fails, there's always Ctrl+C.
